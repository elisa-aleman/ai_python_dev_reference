# AI Python Developer Reference Wiki

Personal collection of documentation and reference guides for AI development with python, from PC setup guides, recommended software to install, to anything I've learned about AI training, quantization, etc.

- Initial setup guides:
    - [Windows setup guide](./docs/setup_guides/Windows-Setup.md)
    - [Linux / WSL setup guide](./docs/setup_guides/Linux-WSL-Setup.md)
    - [MacOS setup guide](./docs/setup_guides/MacOS-Setup.md)
    - [Git Setup and Customization](./docs/setup_guides/Git-Setup-and-Customization.md)
    - [Suggested Tools and Setup](./docs/setup_guides/Suggested-Tools-and-Setup.md)
        - My preferred command line tools, developing environment managers, documentation tools, accessibility references
    - [Web Development tools and guides](./docs/Web-Development)
- [About Quantization](./docs/ai_development/About-Quantization.md)
    - Both a theoretic and practical introduction to quantization, as well as conversion guides for pytorch, onnx, and tensorflow, both for float and quantized models.
    - Particularly of interest is practical examples of the three methods of quantization in pytorch, and ways to export pytorch quantized models to onnx and tflite.
